Simple scala analytics

Scala Part 5
Important (Please Read):
● Make sure the files you submit can be processed by just calling scala
<> on the commandline.1 Use the template files provided and do not
make any changes to arguments of functions or to any types. You are free to implement
any auxiliary function you might need.
● Do not leave any test cases running in your code because this might slow down your
program! Comment out test cases before submission, otherwise you might hit a time‑out.
● Do not use any mutable data structures in your submissions! They are not needed. This
means you cannot create new Arrays or ListBuffers, for example.
● Do not use return in your code! It has a different meaning in Scala than in Java. It
changes the meaning of your program, and you should never use it.
● Do not use var! This declares a mutable variable. Only use val!
● Do not use any parallel collections! No .par therefore! Our testing and marking
infrastructure is not set up for it.
● Also note that the running time of each part will be restricted to a maximum of 30
seconds on my laptop.
Disclaimer
All major OSes, including Windows, have a commandline. So there is no good reason to not
download Scala, install it and run it on your own computer.
As well as the tests in the .scala files, these are the addition tests that need to pass:

#### Compiler Structure

```
// Main Part 5 about a "Compiler" for the Brainf*** language
//============================================================


object M5b {


// !!! Copy any function you need from file bf.scala !!!
//
// If you need any auxiliary function, feel free to 
// implement it, but do not make any changes to the
// templates below.


// DEBUGGING INFORMATION FOR COMPILERS!!!
//
// Compiler, even real ones, are fiendishly difficult to get
// to produce correct code. One way to debug them is to run
// example programs ``unoptimised''; and then optimised. Does
// the optimised version still produce the same result?


// for timing purposes
def time_needed[T](n: Int, code: => T) = {
  val start = System.nanoTime()
  for (i <- 0 until n) code
  val end = System.nanoTime()
  (end - start)/(n * 1.0e9)
}


type Mem = Map[Int, Int]

import io.Source
import scala.util._


// TASKS
//=======

// (5) Write a function jtable that precomputes the "jump
//     table" for a bf-program. This function takes a bf-program 
//     as an argument and Returns a Map[Int, Int]. The 
//     purpose of this map is to record the information about
//     pc positions where '[' or a ']' are stored. The information
//     is to which pc-position do we need to jump next?
// 
//     For example for the program
//  
//       "+++++[->++++++++++<]>--<+++[->>++++++++++<<]>>++<<----------[+>.>.<+<]"
//
//     we obtain the map
//
//       Map(69 -> 61, 5 -> 20, 60 -> 70, 27 -> 44, 43 -> 28, 19 -> 6)
//  
//     This states that for the '[' on position 5, we need to
//     jump to position 20, which is just after the corresponding ']'.
//     Similarly, for the ']' on position 19, we need to jump to
//     position 6, which is just after the '[' on position 5, and so
//     on. The idea is to not calculate this information each time
//     we hit a bracket, but just look up this information in the 
//     jtable. You can use the jumpLeft and jumpRight functions
//     from Part 1 for calculating the jtable.
//
//     Then adapt the compute and run functions from Part 1 
//     in order to take advantage of the information stored in the jtable. 
//     This means whenever jumpLeft and jumpRight was called previously,
//     you should immediately look up the jump address in the jtable.
 

def jtable(pg: String) : Map[Int, Int] = ???


// testcase
//
// jtable("""+++++[->++++++++++<]>--<+++[->>++++++++++<<]>>++<<----------[+>.>.<+<]""")
// =>  Map(69 -> 61, 5 -> 20, 60 -> 70, 27 -> 44, 43 -> 28, 19 -> 6)


def compute2(pg: String, tb: Map[Int, Int], pc: Int, mp: Int, mem: Mem) : Mem = ???
def run2(pg: String, m: Mem = Map()) = ???


// testcases
// time_needed(1, run2(load_bff("benchmark.bf")))
// time_needed(1, run2(load_bff("sierpinski.bf")))



// (6) Write a function optimise which deletes "dead code" (everything
// that is not a bf-command) and also replaces substrings of the form
// [-] by a new command 0. The idea is that the loop [-] just resets the
// memory at the current location to 0. In the compute3 and run3 functions
// below you implement this command by writing the number 0 to mem(mp), 
// that is write(mem, mp, 0). 
//
// The easiest way to modify a string in this way is to use the regular
// expression """[^<>+-,\[\]]""", which recognises everything that is 
// not a bf-command and replace it by the empty string. Similarly the
// regular expression """\[-\]""" finds all occurrences of [-] and 
// by using the Scala method .replaceAll you can replace it with the 
// string "0" standing for the new bf-command.

def optimise(s: String) : String = ???

def compute3(pg: String, tb: Map[Int, Int], pc: Int, mp: Int, mem: Mem) : Mem = ???

def run3(pg: String, m: Mem = Map()) = ???


// testcases
//
// optimise(load_bff("benchmark.bf"))          // should have inserted 0's
// optimise(load_bff("mandelbrot.bf")).length  // => 11205
// 
// time_needed(1, run3(load_bff("benchmark.bf")))



// (7)  Write a function combine which replaces sequences
// of repeated increment and decrement commands by appropriate
// two-character commands. For example for sequences of +
//
//              orig bf-cmds  | replacement
//            ------------------------------
//              +             | +A 
//              ++            | +B
//              +++           | +C
//                            |
//              ...           |
//                            | 
//              +++....+++    | +Z
//                (where length = 26)
//
//  Similar for the bf-command -, > and <. All other commands should
//  be unaffected by this change.
//
//  Adapt the compute4 and run4 functions such that they can deal
//  appropriately with such two-character commands.


def combine(s: String) : String = ???

// testcase
// combine(load_bff("benchmark.bf"))


def compute4(pg: String, tb: Map[Int, Int], pc: Int, mp: Int, mem: Mem) : Mem = ???


// should call first optimise and then combine on the input string
//
def run4(pg: String, m: Mem = Map()) = ???


// testcases
// combine(optimise(load_bff("benchmark.bf"))) // => """>A+B[<A+M>A-A]<A[[....."""

// testcases (they should now run much faster)
// time_needed(1, run4(load_bff("benchmark.bf")))
// time_needed(1, run4(load_bff("sierpinski.bf"))) 
// time_needed(1, run4(load_bff("mandelbrot.bf")))
